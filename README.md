# Simple Furigana

Simple Furigana is an Anki 2.1 add-on providing support for adding or removing furigana on Japanese content in cards.

This plugin is inspired by [ClozeFuriganaTools](https://github.com/golddranks/ClozeFuriganaTools). Some large portions of code have been reused from ClozeFuriganaTools.

Japanese readings are generated by [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en)

Simple Furigana is released under GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Usage

Simple Furigana adds two buttons in the card editor toolbar `Generate readings` and `Delete readings`

![Add and delete furigana](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcsirot/anki-simple-furigana/master/img/screenshot1.png)

Select the field where you want to add furigana and click `Generate readings`.

![Generated furigana](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcsirot/anki-simple-furigana/master/img/screenshot2.png)

When only a portion of text is selected in the field, furigana are only generated for or removed from that selected text portion.
