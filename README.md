# Simple Furigana

Simple Furigana is an Anki 2.1 add-on providing support for adding or removing furigana on Japanese content in cards.

This plugin is inspired by [ClozeFuriganaTools](https://github.com/golddranks/ClozeFuriganaTools). Some large portions of code have been reused from ClozeFuriganaTools.

Japanese readings are generated by [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en)

Simple Furigana is released under GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
