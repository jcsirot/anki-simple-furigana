# Simple Furigana

Simple Furigana is an Anki 2.1 add-on providing support for adding or removing furigana on Japanese content in cards.

This plugin is inspired by [ClozeFuriganaTools](https://github.com/golddranks/ClozeFuriganaTools). Some large portions of code have been reused from ClozeFuriganaTools.

Japanese readings are generated by [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en)

Simple Furigana is released under GPLv3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Download

Simple Furigana is available for download on [the AnkiWeb portal](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1444055400).

## Usage

Simple Furigana adds two buttons in the card editor toolbar `Generate readings` and `Delete readings`

When only a portion of text is selected in the field, furigana are only generated for or removed from that selected text portion.

- Add readings for numbers (default `false`)

Add reading for the kanjis 一二三四五六七八九十.
> :warning: Note that mecab does not handle very well the irregular reading like 二人(ふたり) or 一回(いっかい) and may produce incorrect readings.
